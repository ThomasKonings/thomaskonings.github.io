											<h1>Hi, welcome to my website!</h1>
											<p>About me</p>
										</header>
										<!-- <p> -->
										<p>My name is Thomas Konings, I am a <strong>PhD student</strong> in astrophysics at the <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute of
											Astronomy</a> (<a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KU Leuven</a>), in the team of
											<a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/staff/senior-staff/leen-decin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Dr. Leen Decin.</a>

										I specialise in modeling <strong>star-planet interactions</strong> and how they affect the atmospheres of <strong>exoplanets</strong>.
										 Specifically, this means that I
										 <ul>
											<li><strong>write code</strong> to model <strong>atmospheric physics, </strong></li>
											<li>perform <strong>data analysis</strong> on synthetic and real data, </li>
											<li>keep myself updated on <strong>scientific literature</strong>, </li>
											<li><strong>publish</strong> in peer-reviewed journals, </li>
											<li>and take deep dives into anything that could advance my research. </li>
										  </ul>
										  
										I am enthusiastic about <a href="TeachingOutreach.html"><strong>teaching</strong> and <strong>science communication</strong></a>. 
										You'll regularly find me at <strong>outreach</strong> events, 
										spreading the word about exoplanets and more.</p>

										<h2>Beyond my research</h2>
									</header>

									<p>As much as I enjoy working in astronomy, I thoroughly like to broaden my horizon and expand my knowledge on different topics.
									My interests reach far beyond (astro)physics and I consider this an added value in my professional career.
									You can find an overview <a href="additionaltraining.html">on this page</a> of some of the additional trainings I followed throught the years.

												<h3>Data science & AI</h3>
												<p>I am passionate about data science and artificial intelligence, 
													and I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow in these areas.
													I am fascinated by the power of data to drive insights and inform decision-making, 
													and I believe that AI and machine learning have the potential to revolutionize a wide 
													range of industries and applications. I am learning more and more about these topics 
													through ongoing education and practical experience.</p>

												<h3>Business, innovation & entrepreneurship</h3>
												<p>While I do not have any formal education or professional experience in the world of business development,
													innovation, and entrepreneurship, I am in the processes of educating myself in these areas.
													I participate in courses, challenges and workshops to further learn and experience real-world scenarios.</p>

												<h3>Personal finance</h3>
												<p>I strongly belief in taking control of your financial situation in order to secure a healthy financial future.
													I am embedded in the Belgian financial independence scene and like to educate myself on topics
													such as stock market investing and financial planning, with a particular focus on passive index investing through ETFs. 
													I am no way a financial advisor but I like to discuss the topic with anyone who is willing to.</p>

												<h3>Weather & Climatology</h3>
												<p>I am interested in the field of weather and climatology, particularly as it relates to climate change.
													As a member of a generation facing the crisis of climate change, I am curious about understanding the factors 
													contributing to this issue and finding solutions to mitigate its impact. Through my PhD studies and additional education, 
													I like to deepen my knowledge of weather patterns and climate systems, as well as the current efforts to address climate change.</p>

												<h3>Professional sports career</h3>
												<p>Having competed at the highest national level and in international competitions with both clubs and the 
													national team until age 22, I was forced to end my volleyball career due to a severe shoulder injury.
													Although no longer active at the highest level, the valuable lessons I learned as a professional athlete 
													continue to shape my professional career and personal life. 
													The discipline, and resilience 
													I developed after spending my youth and adolescence in a high performing 
													and competitive environment has helped me to navigate challenging situations in my 
													professional endeavors. Furthermore, my experience balancing a daily training schedule with academic 
													pursuits has taught me the importance of time management and the value of hard work in achieving success.

											<h3>My first peer reviewed publication</h3>
											<p>My first peer-reviewed paper was recently accepted and will be published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.
												I wrote a small article that gives you a basic idea of what the research is about, so that you don't have to read the full paper if you don't want to.
												But just in case you do want to, you can find it <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/11/aa43436-22/aa43436-22.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
