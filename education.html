									<h2>Bachlor in physics</h2>

									<p>[2015-2019]</p>

									<p>I chose to pursue a bachelor's degree in physics to gain a deeper understanding of the world 
										around me at a fundamental level. During my studies, I particularly enjoyed courses that 
										showcased how scientific concepts are applied in both natural phenomena and everyday situations, 
										while also providing a solid theoretical foundation.
										A number of my personal favorites include thermodynamics, 
										differential equations, numerical mathematics, nuclear and solid-state, and ofcourse astronomy. 
										A special mention goes to <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/staff/senior-staff/christoffel-waelkens" 
										target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. emeritus Christoffel Waelkens</a>,
										who sparked my interest in astronomy by his capturing and inspiring way of teaching.
										The full program of the bachelor, including a description of the courses, can be 
										found <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/bachelor-fysica/kortrijk/studieprogramma" 
										target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>

									<p>The program allowed for quite some flexibility to persue interests other than physics.
										On the one hand, this allowed me confirm my interest in <strong>computer science</strong> through the courses Object Oriented 
										Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Statistical Modelling and Data-Analysis.
										On the other hand, I was introduced to <strong>business & innovation</strong> through courses such as New Product and Service Development,
										Production and Logistics Management, and Economics.
										I am still actively learning more about both the above topics.
									</p>

									<p>Due to the combination with employment as a professional athlete based in Roeseslare, I deliberatly spread the three-year program over four years.
										I chose to study at <a href="https://kulak.kuleuven.be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KU Leuven Kulak</a>, a campus
										of KU Leuven based in Kortrijk. This also implied that I could not attend most of the classes and that the majority of courses were done in self-study.
										Luckily, I had the support of a tight community of classmates and faculty who provided crucial lecture notes and recordings, as well as a more accommodating exam schedule.
									</p>
										

									<h2>Master in astronomy and astrophysics</h2>

									<p>[2019-2021]</p>

									<p>Inspired by the introductory course, I enrolled in the master in astronomy and astrophysics at KU Leuven.
										The program could be catered to specific interests with many elective courses, and satisfied my curiosity to
										describe the cosmos in a quantitave way with inspiring courses such as stellar structure & evolution, 
										Nucleosynthesis, Computational astrophysics, Space Weather, Stellar winds and atmospheres, and more.
										The full program of the master, including a description of the courses, can be 
										found <a href="https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/SC_51017025.htm" 
										target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>

										
									</p>
									<p>
										Alhough the theoretical component is indispensable, <strong>modern day astrophysics</strong> is essentially 
										a mixture of data science, numerical modelling, applied mathematics, statistical analysis, 
										high-performance computing, and more.
										The many pratical assignments and exercises during my master education formed a challenging but rewarding opportunity
										to form a strong basis the practical skills in the areas mentioned above. I decided to persue this master education, 
										only after a long internal debate regarding the practical use outside an academic context. 
										Looking back, I believe that my education/training in astrophysics will benefit me in many contexts,
										as the attained skills are transferable into other industries.
